## Problem 1

The following code reads and cleans the Mr. Trash Wheel dataset.

``` r
mrtrash_df = 
  read_excel("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
  sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
  range = "A2:N408") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na (dumpster) %>% 
  mutate (round (sports_balls, digits = 0), as.integer(sports_balls))
```

The following code reads and cleans the Precipitation data for 2017 and
2018 and combines the datasets into one.

``` r
precip_2017 =
  read_excel("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
             sheet = "2017 Precipitation",
             range = "A2:B14") %>% 
  mutate(precip_year = 2017)

precip_2018 =
  read_excel("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
             sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
             range = "A2:B14") %>% 
  mutate(precip_year = 2018)

precip_tidy =
  bind_rows(precip_2017, precip_2018) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate (month.name [month])
```

The above datasets used for problem 1 have the following numbers of
observations: 344 for the Mr. Trash Wheel dataset; 12 for the 2017
Precipitation dataset; 12 for the 2018 Precipitation dataset; and 24 for
the combined precipitation dataset. The following are examples of key
variables from the Mr. Trash Wheel dataset: the mean of weight is
3.262936 tons, with a maximum value of 5.62 tons and a minimum value of
0.96 tons; the mean amount of grocery bags is 1311.2267442; and the mean
amount of cigarette butts are 3.075412810^{4}, with a maximum of
3.110^{5} and a minimum of 980. The following are examples of key
variables from the combined precipitation dataset and the two individual
precipitation datasets: the mean total rainfall across the two years is
4.3025 inches; the mean total rainfall for 2017 alone is 2.7441667
inches; and the mean total rainfall for 2018 is 5.8608333 inches. The
total precipitation in 2018 was 70.33 and the median number of sports
balls in a dumpster in 2017 was 8.
