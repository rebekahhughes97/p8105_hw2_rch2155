## Problem 1

The following code reads and cleans the Mr. Trash Wheel dataset.

``` r
mrtrash_df = 
  read_excel("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
  sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
  range = "A2:N408") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na (dumpster) %>% 
  mutate (round (sports_balls, digits = 0), as.integer(sports_balls))
```

The following code reads and cleans the Precipitation data for 2017 and
2018 and combines the datasets into one.

``` r
precip_2017 =
  read_excel("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
             sheet = "2017 Precipitation",
             range = "A2:B14") %>% 
  mutate(precip_year = 2017)

precip_2018 =
  read_excel("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
             sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
             range = "A2:B14") %>% 
  mutate(precip_year = 2018)

precip_tidy =
  bind_rows(precip_2017, precip_2018) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate (month.name [month])
```

The above datasets used for problem 1 have the following numbers of
observations: 344 for the Mr. Trash Wheel dataset; 12 for the 2017
Precipitation dataset; 12 for the 2018 Precipitation dataset; and 24 for
the combined precipitation dataset. The following are examples of key
variables from the Mr. Trash Wheel dataset: the mean of weight is
3.262936 tons, with a maximum value of 5.62 tons and a minimum value of
0.96 tons; the mean amount of grocery bags is 1311.2267442; and the mean
amount of cigarette butts are 3.075412810^{4}, with a maximum of
3.110^{5} and a minimum of 980. The following are examples of key
variables from the combined precipitation dataset and the two individual
precipitation datasets: the mean total rainfall across the two years is
4.3025 inches; the mean total rainfall for 2017 alone is 2.7441667
inches; and the mean total rainfall for 2018 is 5.8608333 inches. The
total precipitation in 2018 was 70.33 and the median number of sports
balls in a dumpster in 2017 was 8.

## Problem 2

``` r
nycsub_df = 
  read_csv ("./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, route1, route2, route3, route4, route5, route6, route7, route8, route9, route10, route11, entry, vending, entrance_type, ada) %>%
  mutate(recode(entry, YES = TRUE, NO = FALSE))
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_character(),
    ##   `Station Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Station Longitude` = col_double(),
    ##   Route8 = col_double(),
    ##   Route9 = col_double(),
    ##   Route10 = col_double(),
    ##   Route11 = col_double(),
    ##   ADA = col_logical(),
    ##   `Free Crossover` = col_logical(),
    ##   `Entrance Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Entrance Longitude` = col_double()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

The above dataset contains the line, station name, routes 1-11, entry,
vending and entrance type as character variables, station latitude and
longitude as nunerical variables, and ADA compliance and the recoded
entry variable as logical variables. So far to clean the data, clean
names has been done, certain variables have been cut out of the dataset,
and entry has been recoded as a logical variable. The dimensions of the
dataset are 1868 rows by 20 columns. The data is more tidy than what it
was initally but could be made more tidy still.
